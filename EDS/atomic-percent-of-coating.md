# Purposes
- Evaluation of Pt atomic fraction while coated on powder surface.

# Assumptions
- All particles are spherical
- All particles are continuous. no defect, no atoms.
- Coating thickness is constant value. also continuous.

# Dependencies
- Python 3+
- math
- matplotlib

# Results & Remarks
![result of simulation](/EDS/results/pt-effect-nbc-particle.png?raw=true)
- even relatively large particle, atomic fraction of Platinum(as an coating materials for non-conductive samples) are large.
- Pt peak can be effectively retarded by applying really tiny amount of Platinum.
